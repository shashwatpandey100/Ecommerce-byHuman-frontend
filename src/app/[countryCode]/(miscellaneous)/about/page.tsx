          About Us
        </h2>
        <p className="">
          Our brand is a product of human innovation and creativity, built with
          passion, dedication, and a commitment to excellence. <br />
          <br />
          We believe that headwear is more than just an accessory—it's a
          statement, a shield, and a mark of identity for humans seeking
          individuality and self-expression. Each piece we create is infused
          with a story, a purpose, and a desire to inspire confidence in those
          who wear it.

          Our Story
        </h2>
        The name BY HUMANS was inspired by a message sent into space. <br /> In
        2018, when SpaceX launched a Tesla Roadster, it carried a hidden
        inscription on its circuit board that read, "Made on Earth by humans."
        This phrase captured the essence of human creativity, daring, and the
        drive to reach beyond. <br /> Just like that message, BY HUMANS also
        embodies the spirit of innovation and creativity, reminding us of what
        we can achieve together when we dare to dream and build. <br />
        <br />
        Our journey began with the simple yet powerful belief that every product
        should tell a story—one of craftsmanship, courage, and collaboration.
        Each step of our journey has been guided by the values of resilience,
        ambition, and a shared vision for a better tomorrow.

          What We Stand For
        </h2>
        Our designs are rooted in authenticity and purpose. <br />
        Every cap, beanie, and hat is crafted with the idea of embracing human
        expression, individuality, and the joy of being unapologetically
        yourself. <br />
        <br />
        We blend comfort, style, and quality to create pieces that humans can
        count on—whether you're out exploring the world, creating art, building
        dreams, or simply embracing the beauty of everyday life. <br />
        At BY HUMANS, we celebrate diversity, inclusivity, and the boundless
        potential of the human spirit. <br />
        <br /> Our commitment to innovation ensures that our designs remain
        timeless and relevant, offering something special for everyone.
